## about me

![smut](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a37d3253-d8be-48f8-be7a-35e1cdb8b66b)

Hi, I'm Giang, an IT student from VNUHCM-UIT. I'm fascinated by coding, from webdev to software engineering. When I'm not coding, you can catch me poring over Formula 1 or other motorsport data and strategy, inspired by the way cutting-edge tech and some split-second decisions shape every lap. Excited to bring that same precision and curiosity to every project.

For me, curiosity changes everything.
